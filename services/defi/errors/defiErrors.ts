/**
 * DeFi error taxonomy.
 *
 * Spec: docs/defi-strategies-spec.md §16. Mirrors
 * `services/errors/paymentErrors.ts` — classification-only module that
 * NEVER returns raw error text to callers. Every branch returns a
 * curated code; the matching `<DefiError>` component owns user-facing
 * copy and gates `devMessage` behind `__DEV__`.
 *
 * The codes are stable wire identifiers: the backend uses the same
 * strings prefixed with `defi_` (e.g. `defi_tier_exceeds_user_policy`)
 * so a backend-thrown error can be classified on-mobile without ever
 * stringifying an HTTP body.
