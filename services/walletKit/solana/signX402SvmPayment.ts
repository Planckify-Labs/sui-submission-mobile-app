/**
 * `signX402SvmPayment` — Solana x402 payment signer (spec §5.2.1, §5.5,
 * milestone M6).
 *
 * This module is the Path B-SVM counterpart to
 * `services/walletKit/evm/signTransferWithAuthorization.ts`. Given a
 * base64-encoded versioned Solana transaction pre-built by the backend
 * (ComputeBudget × 2, SPL Token `TransferChecked`, optional Memo per
 * §5.2.1 wire format) — already partially signed with the facilitator's
 * fee-payer slot as a placeholder — this signer adds the user's
 * signature over the message bytes and returns the updated base64 tx.
 *
 * Isolated from `SolanaWalletKit.ts` so the pure signing path is
 * Node-testable without pulling the kit's keystore transitive imports
 * (`expo-secure-store`, MMKV, …) into the test harness. The kit wraps
 * this with a `getSolanaSignerForWallet` lookup so the private key
 * never leaves the `services/walletService.ts` dwell site (TWV-2026-070).
 *
 * Rules (non-negotiable — enforced by spec + review):
 *   - Adapter signs only. Submission is the backend facilitator's job
 *     (task 43 — SVM facilitator backend). No network I/O here.
 *     Memory: `feedback_role_separation.md`.
 *   - Instruction list MUST NOT be mutated. `partiallySignTransaction`
 *     from `@solana/kit` is chosen precisely because it signs over the
 *     existing `messageBytes` — rewriting instructions would invalidate
 *     the scheme (spec §5.2.1: "facilitator already expects the
 *     instructions verbatim").
 *   - Fee-payer signature slot is not touched. The facilitator attaches
 *     it at settle time; the wallet only fills its own slot.
 *   - Never log `messageBytes`, signatures, or the signer's keyPair.
 *     On failure, propagate the thrown error — the adapter's caller
 *     surfaces a bounded `__DEV__` breadcrumb (matching the pattern in
 *     `services/chains/solana/signer.ts`).
 *   - No `react` / `react-native` / `expo` imports — this module must
 *     run under the Node `--experimental-strip-types` test harness.
 *
 * TODO(spec §12 Q7): the x402 SVM RFC
 * (`github.com/coinbase/x402/issues/646` — Deadline Validation + Smart
 * Wallet Support) may add additional authorization fields (e.g. a
 * pre-hashed "authorization digest" the wallet signs alongside the tx).
 * If that lands before M6 ships, the extra field becomes a second
 * argument here and the facilitator proxy (task 43) forwards it
 * through. Until then the partial-sign path matches the current
 * `scheme_exact_svm` draft.
