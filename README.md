# TakumiPay (mobile)

## Official distribution channels (TWV-2026-065)

These are the **only** places a genuine TakumiPay binary is ever
published. If you found a "Takumi" installer somewhere that is not
listed here — a paid search ad, a sideloaded `.apk`, a desktop app, a
browser extension — it is not ours. Do not install it.

- **Apple App Store:** https://apps.apple.com/app/takumi-wallet/id000000000
- **Google Play Store:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.planckify.takumiwallet
- **Website:** https://takumi.ai
- **X:** https://x.com/takumi_ai
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/cstralpt
- **Discord:** https://discord.gg/takumi

App identifiers:

- **iOS Bundle ID:** `com.planckify.takumiwallet`
- **Android Package:** `com.planckify.takumiwallet`
- **Signing-cert SHA-256:** shown in the in-app **About** screen (Wallet
  tab → About). Users can compare the published fingerprint to what the
  OS reports. The value in `constants/about.ts` is the source of truth;
  updates require security-team review.

## Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Troubleshooting

### EAS Build Errors

If you encounter the following error during EAS build:

```
Build failed
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile exited with non-zero code: 1
```

**Temporary solution:**
- For EAS builds: Delete the pnpm lock file before building
- For local machine: Run the following command:
  ```bash
  pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts
  ```

## Building the App

### Development Build

To create a development build for Android:

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

This command will build the app using the development profile defined in your eas.json file, which includes development client features for testing.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
