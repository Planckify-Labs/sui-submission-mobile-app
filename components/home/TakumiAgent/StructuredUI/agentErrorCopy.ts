/**
 * agentErrorCopy — the single mapping from an agent tool failure to
 * user-facing copy.
 *
 * A failed `ToolResult` carries two curated strings (see
 * `services/agent-executors/types.ts`):
 *   - `error`  — the COARSE code from the closed `ExecutorErrorCode` taxonomy
 *                (`stale_precondition`, `insufficient_funds`, …). The agent
 *                branches on this; it changes rarely.
 *   - `reason` — the OPTIONAL granular sub-reason (`intent_expired`,
 *                `quote_stale`, `amount_below_minimum`, …). Open per-tool
 *                detail, set from the thrown `ExecutorError.message`.
 *
 * Every failure card runs both through here so it can be specific WITHOUT ever
 * rendering a raw code (CLAUDE.md user-facing-errors). Lookup prefers the more
 * specific `reason`, then falls back to the coarse `error`, then a friendly
 * generic line. New protocols get sensible copy for free: their failures land
 * on an existing coarse code, and a bespoke `reason` only needs an entry here
 * if it deserves more specific wording than its code's default.
 *
 * All copy is hand-written — no raw runtime / response text reaches the user.
